# Gnoverse Community

Welcome to the Gnoverse Community repo. This repo is community-maintained, designed
by the community for the community. 

It's a place for you to open issues and PRs for other community members to provide 
feedback, review and contribute, a peer-driven approach. There is no fixed approach,
it is up to the community to set the guidelines that work. If you have ideas on how 
to draft the community guidelines to make the experience easy, jump in and suggest
them. 

If you make an issue or PR, think of your fellow reviewers, provide context,
screenshots, and logical commits to make collaboration smoother. If you are a 
reviewer, following a similar approach of thoughtful, respectful, detailed and 
constructive reviews will be appreciated. Ask questions, these will always help 
advance the review. 

TODO:
